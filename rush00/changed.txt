        *.html ->   Renamed all ".html" files to ".php", because ".html" files cannot execute PHP Code.
                    Removed all <nav> tags and rather included a 'templates/header.php' at the top of each file. Makes files less bulky.
        sign_up.php ->  Added 'method="post"' to <form> tag.
        index.php ->    Created this file, it is a requirement and it only redirects the user to home_page.php.
